The dataset contains details of the person interested in buying a bike and whether he has bought one or not. 


First step is to clean the data.

1. Remove duplicates - 26 duplicate values are found and removed.

2. Change the abbreviation in Gender column M/F (Male and Female) and Marital Status M/S (Married Single).

3. Add a column to group the Age of customers into 3 categories Adolescence (0-31), Middle Age (32-54), Old(> 54)

4. Create Pivot tables and compute solution for:

	Does the customerâ€™s income affect his/her purchase option?

	Does purchase option depend on the Commuting distance of customer?

	Do only customers of a particular age group prefer the bike?
